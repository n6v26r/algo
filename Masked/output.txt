Help the Masked
Lady decode
messages sent
to her by the
double agents,
Quick Brown Fox
and Lazy Dog.
Each letter has
been replaced by
“masked”: the
capitalisation
of the “m”
indicating the
capitalisation
of the
corresponding
letter; that of
the “asked”
forming a
binary code
(with n
indicating
letter n in the
alphabet). All
other
characters are
unchanged.
Write a program
whose input is
an encoded
message of
between 1 and 1000000
characters. You
should output
the decoded
message
