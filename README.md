# algo
Some (very few) of my solutions to different algorithmic / competitive programming problems. These are mostly from romanian competitions.
Most of the problems (>90%) do not have a url to their website and are pretty much here only so that I can sync or share them better.

Might decide to organize more efficiently later.

Most problems are from the following platforms:

https://kilonova.ro
https://pbinfo.ro

Have fun!
